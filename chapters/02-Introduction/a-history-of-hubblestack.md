# The History of HubbleStack

> I once had a friend and mentor, the larger-than-life Leif Svalgaard, who would
> work secretly on some amazing code and then show the finished results to
> general astonishment. When we asked him how he did it, he invariably answered
> with a huge Santa Clause grin, palms up innocently, saying, "it's magic!" Once
> Leif wrote a tiny but working multitasking system for DOS over the weekend,
> just to disprove Microsoft's claims that OS/2 (yes, this was some time ago)
> needed 8 Megabytes of memory "because it did multitasking". As he started a
> compilation in one window, and edited a file in another, I asked him, "how did
> you do this?" "Ah, it's magic!" he answered.

> Incidentally, that tiny multitasking system (1,000 lines of x86 assembly)
> inspired my multithreading SMT kernel in 1995, which became the heart of our
> server technology and then OpenAMQ, which led the way to ZeroMQ. So it goes in
> the history of software, a chain of inspiration and culture
