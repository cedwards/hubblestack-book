HubbleStack: Open-Source Security Monitoring

## Book Description
HubbleStack was designed using a powerful framework that allows todays biggest
enterprises to manage tens and even hundreds-of-thousands of servers. Focusing
on scalability, flexibility and transparency, HubbleStack has quickly become
the tool of choice for many IT professionals. With this book you will learn how
to leverage HubbleStack to better define, understand and actively monitor your
IT security.

In this book you will learn the motivation for and history behind the project.
You'll find step-by-step instructions on installation and examples of running
your first commands. You'll also learn about extending Hubble for individual
use cases. From there you will explore the main components of Hubble and learn
how to compare your systems against industry best practices. Finally, you will
discover some of the specific lenses HubbleStack uses to view the digital
universe. We'll finish by exploring how to get involved with HubbleStack and
what's happening in the HubbleStack community.

Finally, by the end of this book, you will be able to audit your systems, take
snapshots of system activity, watch for real-time security events and
report all of this using a flexible and modular reporting engine.
